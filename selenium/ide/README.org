* Selenium IDE Tests for AmiGO 2
** Overview

AmiGO 2 now has a set of test suites to make sure that basic
functionality is available. The suites are GO/GOlr oriented and may
need changes when being adapted to other AmiGO 2 installations.

Currently, the default URL of each suite is
http://amigo2.berkeleybop.org/amigo/ , but this is easily
changed in the invididual suite files.

The suites will fail if no GOlr backend is available.

*** amigo2-test-suite-core

These tests cover the existance of the main AmiGO 2 features that can
be directly linked to, like Search, the landing page, and a term details
page.

*** amigo2-test-suite-ac

These tests cover the use of various autocomplete inputs on an
assortment of pages.

*** amigo2-test-suite-search

These tests cover some basic search operations using the Search
component.

** Usage

Currently, the developer creates and runs these tests using the
Selenium IDE in Firefox.
